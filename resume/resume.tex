    and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Equation} %\\ Advisor: Bernard Deconinck
    \begin{itemize*}
    \item Led the design and development of ``Abelfunctions'', an open-source
      mathematics software package for computing with Abelian functions and
      Riemann surfaces.
    \item Designed and improved new and existing algorithms using a wide variety
      of tools from various branches of mathematics, such as numerical analysis,
      linear analysis, and algebraic geometry; as well as using high-performance
      software development strategies.
    \item Used object-oriented design principles to create software that was
      easy for mathematicians to use yet maintained high performance standards
      while providing extendibility to future developers.
    \item Mentored team of bright undergraduate students in developing
      algorithms for quickly and accurately computing the Riemann theta
      function.
    \item Open-source code available on GitHub:
      \url{https://github.com/abelfunctions/abelfunctions}
    \end{itemize*}
  \item {\bf M.S. in Applied Mathematics}, University of Washington, Seattle,
    June 2010 \\ Thesis: {\it A Python Implementation of Chebyshev Functions}
    \begin{itemize*}
    \item Studied high-performance and high-accuracy function interpolation
      using Chebyshev polynomials.
    \item Created ``Pychebfun'', a Python library implementing these
      interpolation algorithms using tools from the Numpy and Scipy libraries:
      \url{https://github.com/cswiercz/pychebfun}
    \end{itemize*}
